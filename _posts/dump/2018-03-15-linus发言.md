It looks like the IT security world has hit a new low.If you work in security, and think you have some morals, I think you might want to add the tag-line   "No, really, I'm not a whore. Pinky promise"to your business card. Because I thought the whole industry was corrupt before, but it's getting ridiculous.At what point will security people admit they have an attention-whoring problem?  

恩，又学到了一个单词，pinky promise。。。哈哈哈，拉小拇指保证。
